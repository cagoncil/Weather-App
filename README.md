# Weather App

### ⛅ About ⛅

This weather app is my personal endeavor to familiarize myself with back-end technologies like Node.js and Express. Click [here](http://cagoncil-weather.herokuapp.com/) to visit the [live demo](http://cagoncil-weather.herokuapp.com/).

### 🌨️ How it works 🌨️
To check the weather of a location, enter the location name in the search box on the homepage. Your location can be as specific as a full mailing address, but at the very minimum, should be a city name or a zip code. You can toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius depending on your preference.

There are different app designs depending on the current weather conditions of the location you look up! Specifically, there are:

- Clear skies (daytime)
- Clear skies (nighttime)
- Partly cloudy (daytime)
- Partly cloudy (nighttime)
- Cloudy
- Windy
- Fog
- Rain
- Snow
- Sleet
- Storm (Extremely rare. Hail, thunder, tornado, etc.)

Have you been able to find them all?
